#Christian Shinkle's Pencil Durability Kata Submission

The following are the tools I used to develop my submission and where:

Java (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html)
Gradle 5.4.1 (https://gradle.org/install/)

Gradle 5 requires Java 8 or newer to run. I developed all the code using 11. 

Build should be as simple as running gradlew build for *nix systems or running gradlew.bat for Windows.
