# Christian Shinkle's Pencil Durability Kata Submission

The following are the tools I used to develop my submission:

Java (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html)

Gradle 5.4.1 (https://gradle.org/install/)

Gradle 5 requires Java 8 or newer to run. I developed all the code using Java 11. 

Building should be as simple as running gradlew build for Unix systems or running gradlew.bat for Windows.

Tests will be ran with gradlew build but if you just need to run tests, the command is gradlew test.
